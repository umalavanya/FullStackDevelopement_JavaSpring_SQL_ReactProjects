Problem Statement:
As a Java Developer at XYZ Solutions, you have been assigned to develop
the following programs given below. You have to make sure that the programs
are efficient in terms of Space Complexity as well as Time Complexity.
Requirements:
1. Write a Java program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
Examples:
Output: Hello, World!
2. Program to find the sum of two numbers: The program should prompt
the user to enter two numerical values and calculate their sum.
Requirements:
a. The program should prompt the user to enter the first number.
b. Take the input for the first number from the user.
c. The program should prompt the user to enter the second number.
d. Take the input for the second number from the user.
e. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
f.
Display the sum as the output.
Examples:
Input: 5, 7
Output: Sum: 12
Input:-10, 20
Output: Sum: 10
Constraints:
Integers within the range of-2^31 to 2^31- 1
3. Implement a Java program to swap the values of two variables
without using a temporary variable.
Examples:
Input: a = 5, b = 10
Output: After swapping: a = 10, b = 5

Input: a =-7, b = 3
Output: After swapping: a = 3, b =-7
Constraints: None
4. Write a Java program to find the maximum of three numbers.
Examples:
Input: 5, 12, 8
Output: Maximum: 12
Input:-3,-10,-6
Output: Maximum:-3
Constraints: Integers within the range of-2^31 to 2^31- 1
5. Program to check if a number is prime: A prime number is a natural
number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and
itself.
Requirements:
a. The program should prompt the user to enter an integer greater
than 1.
b. Check whether the entered number is a prime number or not.
c. Display an appropriate message if the number is prime or not.
Examples:
Input: 7
Output: Prime
Input: 10
Output: Not Prime
Constraints: The input number is a positive integer greater than 1.
6. Create a program that generates and prints the first N terms of the
Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is
the sum of the two preceding ones.

Requirements:
a. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of terms
they want in the Fibonacci series.
b. Generate the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of terms
using a loop.
c. Display the generated Fibonacci series as the output.
Examples:
Input: N = 7
Output: Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Input: N = 10
Output: Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
Constraints: N is a positive integer.
7. Program to find the factorial of a number: The factorial of a
non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to 'n'.
Requirements:
a. The program should prompt the user to enter a non-negative
integer 'n'.
b. Calculate the factorial of 'n' using an iterative approach.
c. Display the factorial of 'n' as the output.
d. Handle the case when the user enters a negative number or zero.
Examples:
Input: 5
Output: Factorial: 120
Input: 0
Output: Factorial: 1
Constraints: The input is a non-negative integer.
8. Implement a program to find the sum of even numbers between 1
and N.
Examples:
Input: N = 10
Output: Sum of even numbers: 30

Input: N = 15
Output: Sum of even numbers: 56
Constraints: N is a positive integer.
9. Write a Java program to reverse a given string.
Examples:
Input: "hello"
Output: Reversed string: "olleh"
Input: "Intellipaat"
Output: Reversed string: "taapilletnI"
Constraints: None
10. Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome or
not.
Examples:
Input: "radar"
Output: Palindrome
Input: "Intellipaat"
Output: Not Palindrome
Constraints: None
